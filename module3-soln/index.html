      <p class="item-name">Covaxin</p>
      <p>Covaxin (codenamed as BBV152) is an inactivated virus-based COVID-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research. As an inactivated vaccine, Covaxin uses a more traditional technology that is similar to the inactivated polio vaccine. It is a 2-dose vaccination regimen given 28 days apart. The vaccine candidate is produced with Bharat Biotech's in-house vero cell manufacturing platform that has the capacity to deliver about 300 million doses. The company is in the process of setting up a second plant at its Genome Valley facility in Hyderabad to make Covaxin. The firm in collaboration with Government of Odisha is establishing another facility at Odisha Biotech Park in Bhubaneswar to commence Covaxin production by June 2022. Besides this, they are also exploring global tie-ups for Covaxin manufacturing.<a href="#top"><br>Back to Top</a></p>

      <p class="item-name">Covishield</p>
      <p>The Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, codenamed AZD1222, and sold under the brand names Covishield and Vaxzevria among others, is a viral vector vaccine for prevention of COVID-19. Developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, it is given by intramuscular injection, using as a vector the modified chimpanzee adenovirus. The vaccine is stable at refrigerator temperatures and costs around US$3 to US$4 per dose. The vaccine has a good safety profile, with side effects including injection-site pain, headache, and nausea, all generally resolving within a few days. On 17 December 2020, a tweet by the Belgian Budget State Secretary revealed that the European Union (EU) would pay €1.78 (US$2.16) per dose, The New York Times suggesting the lower price might relate to factors including investment in vaccine production infrastructure by the EU.<a href="#top"><br>Back to Top</a></p>

      <p class="item-name">Sputnik V</p>
      <p>Sputnik V (Russian: Спутник V) is an adenovirus viral vector vaccine for COVID-19 developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. The 'V' in its name is the letter and not the Roman numeral. Dr Reddy's has started inoculation with Russia's Sputnik V as part of the soft launch in India. Gam-COVID-Vac was initially approved for distribution in Russia and then in 59 other countries (as of April 2021) on the preliminary results of Phase I–II studies eventually published on 4 September 2020. Approval in early August of Gam-COVID-Vac was met with media criticism in mass media and discussions in the scientific community as to whether approval was justified in the absence of robust scientific research confirming safety and efficacy.On 2 February 2021, an interim analysis from the trial was published in The Lancet, indicating 91.6% efficacy without unusual side effects.<a href="#top"><br>Back to Top</a></p>
